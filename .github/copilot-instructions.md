# Workshop repository — Copilot instructions

This repo is the **Azure Platform Engineering workshop**. It is intentionally split into two parts:

| Folder | Owner | Copilot scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workload-app/` | The "application team" (out of scope for this workshop) | **Read-only. No exceptions.** Do not create, edit, move, or delete any file under this path — including Dockerfiles, `.dockerignore`, or anything else. |
| `mock-alz/` | Workshop hub / shared landing zone | Read-only reference. Modify only when the chore explicitly says so. |
| `dockerfiles/` | Platform team | This is where the workload container build assets live (Dockerfiles, `.dockerignore`, nginx config, build/deploy scripts). |
| Everything else (`infra/`, `bicep/`, `.github/`, READMEs, etc.) | The platform team (you + the workshop participant) | Editable. This is where the chores happen. |

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Never create, edit, move, or delete anything under `workload-app/`.** Not the `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.tsx`, `.ts`, `package.json`, `appsettings.json`, `index.html`, **and not Dockerfiles or `.dockerignore` either**. The application is treated as a finished, immutable artifact the platform team has been handed. **No exceptions.** If a chore appears to require a change inside `workload-app/`, the participant does that edit by hand — Copilot does not.
2. **Reading `workload-app/` is encouraged.** Read the code to understand what the app needs (runtime, ports, env vars, database, egress, etc.) so the platform design is grounded in reality.
3. **Dockerfiles for the app live under `dockerfiles/`**, not inside `workload-app/`. Layout:
   - `dockerfiles/backend/Dockerfile` (for the .NET 10 API in `workload-app/backend/HotelBooking.Api/`)
   - `dockerfiles/frontend/Dockerfile` (for the Vite/React SPA in `workload-app/frontend/`)
   - Any `.dockerignore`, nginx config, or build/deploy scripts go alongside them under `dockerfiles/`.
   Each Dockerfile's build context is the matching `workload-app/` subfolder, set explicitly at build time (`az acr build --file dockerfiles/backend/Dockerfile workload-app/backend/HotelBooking.Api`). The source tree stays untouched.
4. **No application-level instructions.** Do not propose or follow guidance about C#, .NET, EF Core, React, Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript, or test frameworks. Those are the application team's concern.
5. **Container base images must come from `mcr.microsoft.com` (Microsoft Container Registry), not Docker Hub.** This applies to every `FROM` line in any `Dockerfile` you author in this repo (platform-team images and the workload `Dockerfile`s allowed by rule 3). Prefer the first-party Microsoft image; if no MCR equivalent exists for a base image you need (e.g. a community runtime), stop and ask the user before falling back to Docker Hub. Examples: use `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:<tag>` and `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:<tag>` for .NET, `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/nodejs:<tag>` for Node, `mcr.microsoft.com/azurelinux/base/nginx:<tag>` for nginx, `mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/base/python:<tag>` (or the Azure Linux equivalent) for Python.
6. **Stay inside the current chore. Do not name, number, or reference future chores in any artifact (docs, diagrams, Bicep comments, scripts, commit messages, chat output). Do not pre-bake parameters, SKUs, file paths, or code branches for requirements that have not been stated in the current chore.** If the current chore says "the plan should be detailed enough that the next chore can implement it", that means write a self-contained design — *not* "Chore 4 will…". The participant drives chores in order; you do not get to peek. If something genuinely must be deferred, say **"out of scope for this design"** or **"a follow-up implementation"** without naming or numbering the future work. The only files where you may write `Chore N` are `CHORES.md`, `DETAILS.md`, and `README.md` — nowhere else.

## What this workshop is about

Hub-and-spoke Azure Landing Zone with **distributed Private DNS zones** (each workload resource group owns its own Private DNS zones, linked back to the hub vnet). Two chores:

- **Chore 1 — Spoke onboarding:** stand up a new spoke (vnet, peering to hub, route tables, Private DNS zones) using Bicep + AVM.
- **Chore 2 — Workload investigation & design:** read `workload-app/`, then produce a Markdown design document that includes an embedded architecture diagram (use the `drawio` skill — export PNG with embedded XML). Requirements: Well-Architected, scale-to-zero where possible, **private endpoints for all services except the container registry, monitoring and the public-facing frontend**. The plan is the deliverable; no infra code is required for this chore. 

## How to work in this repo

- Prefer **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)** for any Bicep — see [.github/instructions/azure-verified-modules-bicep.instructions.md](.github/instructions/azure-verified-modules-bicep.instructions.md).
- Follow **Microsoft CAF naming** — see [.github/instructions/azure-naming.instructions.md](.github/instructions/azure-naming.instructions.md).
- Architecture diagrams referenced from Markdown must be authored via the **`drawio` skill** under [.github/skills/drawio/SKILL.md](.github/skills/drawio/SKILL.md) and exported as PNG (with embedded `.drawio` XML) so the source stays editable.
- Use the **`azure-principal-architect`** or **`plan`** chat modes for design conversations, and **`bicep-plan` / `bicep-implement`** for IaC work.
- Run **`azure-deployment-preflight`** (Bicep what-if + permission checks) before any `az deployment` command.

## When in doubt

Never edit anything inside `workload-app/` — there is no "ask first" path for that folder; refuse and tell the user to do it by hand. Ask the user before:
- Adding new top-level folders.
- Introducing a new Azure service that wasn't already on the table for the current chore.
- Running anything that touches a real Azure subscription (deployments, role assignments, resource creation).

## other important instructions
- the container registry, monitoring, and the public frontend are the only workload components that can have a public endpoint. Every other service must be locked down with private endpoints and/or service endpoints, and all inter-service communication must stay on the Microsoft backbone via Private DNS and peering.
- you must make sure the local az cli principal has RBAC permissions to deploy all the resources in the Bicep templates, including the ability to create role assignments for user-assigned managed identities. If any permission is missing, the deployment will fail. Use `az role assignment create` to grant the necessary permissions before deployment. Also use this principal as an administrator for SQL Db.

## Self-check before you finish a turn

Before returning your final answer or saving any artifact, grep your own output and any files you wrote/edited for the regex `Chore \d`. If it matches **and** the hit is not inside `CHORES.md`, `DETAILS.md`, or `README.md`, you have violated rule 6 — go back and remove the reference (replace with "a follow-up implementation" or "out of scope for this design") before responding.
